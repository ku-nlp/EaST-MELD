Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing there that isn't burned is an ax, which I do not remember buying.
That’s laughter.
And I’m appalled for you by the way.
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.
no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.
I love you Phoebe.
Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...
Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
Oh, poor Lily.
Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it  won’t stop crying.
So, I hear, you hate me!
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
Thanks Mon!
My best shoes, so good to me.
I wear them everyday.
My feet’s best friends, pals to the end.
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Oh, she’s gonna love that!
Oh. Oh, it’s beautiful. I see it now.
Okay, all right, I think you’re great, I think you’re sweet, and you’re smart, and I love you.
Great! It’s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was
It's okay to laugh right?
Whoa!  I kinda liked it.
That’s not true!
I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.
Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Everybody smile!  Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's.
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
Alright, well, be good, I love you.
Yeah. No. No...
I’m sorry, it’s just that you’re so incredibly beautiful.
I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don’t want to hurt you.
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.
I’m sorry Joey.
I know. I like it up here.
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years.
Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
I'm sorry, man.
Yeah, y’know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It’ll be cute, okay?
What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.
Don’t I deserve a few tears?!!
I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
No!
You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me!
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don’t get.
No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office.
You're so pretty.
Oh, what a fun office.
No, the little girl creeps me out.
Why would the baby creep me out?
Why would the little girl creep you out?
I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!"
Sweetie, with you it’s gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, ‘cause you-you guys are in love.
I’m so exited!
Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress?
Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it?
Tommyyyy! Say, what’s your favourite thing about summer?
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Oh, that sounds great.
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Wow.
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
The joke sucks!
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
I don't want to get too... excited.
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
The point is, I don't need this right now.
Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
Toby! I’m not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!
Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!
That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’m over it already.
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
How bad is this?
Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most.
It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.
I'm not reading this!
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
What is wrong with Emma?
Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Joey, I’m sorry.
Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick ‘cause this is killing me.
It was really fun being married to you tonight.
And that’s I’m so glad… there’s no problem.
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out.
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
No, but you're questioning my method!
It’s…it’s complicated okay?
It’s just if-if we got together again and it didn’t work out…I could never do that to Emma.
God. I forgot how much I love driving.
Okay, in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me.
Oh my God!
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
I don’t want a ghost.
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I’m happy all the time!
You are so great! I love you!
You love me!
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye!  Hi!
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
God, oh it’s just perfect!
What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much!
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
He fell asleep too!
Or, call an ambulance.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Oh, do you need a hug? You don’t have to bring me anything!
Aren't we a little old for this?
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!
Ooooohh!
Yep! That's hilarious!
Tasty! I’m really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it’s-it’s nice.
I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex.
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
I mean, I love-I love this little guy!
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
I came here to tell you I still love you.
Joey, I am scared to death about this.
I was scared of telling you.
Well I’d be scared of them, but all right.
Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.
We’re gonna be all right. I mean, even if we’re not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
I had a really nice time tonight.
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
Joel-burg, you maniac!
See, I see.... big passion in your future.
I love you, too.
What? I’m just sad.
I would love to live with you Ross.. that’s-that’s great! Thank you!
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Yeah, it was really hard.
This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!
I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s.
This sucks!
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!
I love hiking!
Come on! Look where you are!!
There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident.
Monica, betting the apartment, I don’t know about this.
And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.
Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... It's not funny!
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
Are you kidding? I love that guy!  Morning’s here! Morning is here—
I am hurt!  A plague on both your houses!
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.
Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
Oh, you're so wonderful.
Well we?re gonna miss you around here.
That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife!
That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!
I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey.
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this.
It's brilliant!
Everything was delicious!
What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
It is the right time.
That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
I really like waking up with you.
No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
I can’t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.
You are so adorable.
Oh my God.
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.
Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it.
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
So Chandler, your parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.
I-I cannot spend another evening with that man.
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
You’re so pretty. I love you.
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don’t!
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’
You don't even know me...
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.
Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
Give it to me!
...in love with you.
Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now?
Terrified.
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
I knew it, wow!!
Ohh, so cute.
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’m engaged.
Well you should be embarrassed.
I did, but that was really fun.
You’re the worst best man ever!
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
So you like the drums!
That's fun.
Really?!
I don’t know!
Yeah?
What’s going on?
I know!
What are you doing here?
What?
I’m sorry.
What?!
Yeah!
Why not?
No.
Done.
Oh my God.
What?
Really?!
What?!
What?
What’s going on?
No.
Oh, me too.
Really?!
Really?
Thank you.
Hi!
What?
I know!
What?!
What?
You really think so?
No.
I know!
Excuse me?
What are you doing?
I know! At $4.99 for a pillow-top queen said, who cares about the divorce?
What?
Really?!
I’m so sorry!
Hi!
Hi!
Why?
Are you kidding?
Hey!
For what?
Are you sure?
Okay? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up, okay?
Oh my God!
Really stupid.
Really stupid.
What?!
Of course!
No.
Why not?!
Chandler!
What are you doing?
Really?
Oh my God.
What happened?
What?!
Me too.
What?!
You think?
What are you doing?
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out.
You can’t marry him!
Like what?
What do you mean?
Really?!
What?
All right!
Yeah?
Really?
Of course!
Yeah, maybe.
Really?!
Really?!
Hi!
What?!
Really?!
No!
Phoebe!
No.
Good.
Hi!
Really?!
What?
I know!
Are you kidding?
No.
Yeah!
Really?!
No way!
Got me.
Done.
What are you doing here?
I’m so sorry!
No.
Really?!
Really.
I guess.
Okay!
What?
No!
Why?
Thanks.
Really?
Yeah!
What?
So what are you gonna do?
Oh my God!!
Oh my God!
I don’t know!
What?
Uh-huh.
What are you doing?
Really?
No.
Excuse me?
Really?
Oh, me too.
Oh, me too.
What?
What?
Thank you.
Yeah?
Chandler!
Really?
Oh my God.
I’m sorry.
Really?
Why not?
Oh my God!
Ross!
So I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you could tell him. Go!
No!
Come on!
Thank you.
Got me.
Phoebe!
Thanks.
What?
What did you just say?
Yes!
Yeah, maybe.
Good! Switch here.
Ross!
What?!
Why?
Thanks a lot.
Oh, great!
Oh my God!
No.
Why?
Why?
Oh, great!
What are you doing?
I’m sorry.
Thanks.
Oh yeah.
Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else.
No, no. Yes!
That’s right! Cause I'm a Tribbiani. This is what we do.
Really?
Sorry.
What?!
Why not?
No!
Me too.
No!
Yeah!
Thanks.
Really?!
That’s right! yeah, you made me feel really guilty about going out with that girl.
Thanks.
Are you sure?
Yeah!
Oh God.
What’s the matter?
What’s going on?
Hey!
What?
What are you doing?
All right!
Really?
