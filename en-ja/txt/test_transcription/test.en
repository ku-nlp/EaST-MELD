Oh.  No! No wait, that’s weird!
I mean, wow!
Oh-ho, and mine!
It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much.
Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
I know, they’re gonna be so happy together.
No! I’m so happy for them!
Me too! So happy for them!
Stop callin’!!
So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!
Ooh, nice.
Yeah, I’m just mad!
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
This game is kinda fun.
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.
Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?
But I didn’t want to.
Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
In that, um, they don't.
Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know.
I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh.
That’s a little more than I wanted to see.
Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun.
I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
Oh, God! He's such a pig.
Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out.
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Oh that’s terrible. I’m-I’m really sorry.
That sucks!
Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!
Thank you…we’re so excited.
Are you excited?
Oh umm, I-I don’t know if I want to wear a woman’s shirt.
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
It’s too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meant to be.
I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
That’s funny, yeah!
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
Try. There’s my little girl.
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!
Four, please.  I’m really nervous.  Thank you.
Ohh, that’s too bad!
No, I-I’m saying I liked her.
Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie.
The nerve huh?
Oh, it’s crazy about Rachel huh?
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.
Okay, we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to come.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Well Joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you.
Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know.
Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
That's funny. Who are they?
Otherwise, you’re just mean!
That’s kinda sad.
Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you.
Ooh, Phoebe’s here! Okay, let’s turn out all the lights and we’ll just watch the movie!
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Sorry.
Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!
You suck!!
Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great.
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
He does not look happy.
Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard.
Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
I like this one.  It seems to say, "I love you and that’s why I have to kill you."
I’m having a really good time!
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.
Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.
Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you.
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Awesome!
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Yeah, I don't like that word.
I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her?
Oh, this is so cute.
My mommies love me. That's clever.
I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.
Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories.
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It’s amazing how she gets it right almost every time.
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they’re my favorite. Thank you.
This is so great!
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
For what it’s worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even think about it...
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
I have.
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will.
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people.
Yeah!
The silk? Feels really good!
Yeah—No!!
It just keeps getting worse and worse!
Fabulous.
No, we’re not!!
You are so sweet.
I'm just gonna come out and say it, okay? Uh, I...
I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!  Ohhh!
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!
I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard!
Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet.
Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
So-so that’s-that’s what I’m doing, now.
It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it’s so much fun!
Yes I do!
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.
Kiss me.
I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain’t that funny?
That I was not expecting.
No, thank you!
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.
You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!
Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
That’s the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
That means nothing to me.  Come on!
Oh wow, you didn’t even try to unhook my bra!
Listen I uh…  It’s a scary world out there especially if you’re a single mom.
I love you!
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Would you stop that!
They loved me!
Ohh that’s so sweet!
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time!
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
if you don’t get that...
Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.
No!!
And shame on you!
You’re disgusting!
Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you.
Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
This team is about hard work, but it’s also about having fun.
Good to have you aboard Bing!
Ben is way cuter than that kid.
You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
Oh, hello liar.
Great! Great!  You’re making the bike very happy.
Everything on your application looks really good—Ohh!
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Ohh. And I don’t even have a date.
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!
I don't know you guys.
Well, I’m very glad you’re here.
Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
One!  No ten! You said ten! You can’t take that back!
Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!
Nice,  thank you.
Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you!
Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
I love her books!
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that’s the first A I’ve gotten since seventh grade, and I didn't have to sleep with the teacher this time.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Oh, god.
Aw, we-we are so… So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you.
And I mean-I’m having a lot of fun.
They taste so good.
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me.
I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Oh, that is so unfortunate.
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.
We are not going to whistle.
I’m torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
I’m great! I’m great. Got a great job at Bloomingdale's. I have wonderful friends. And even though I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've really never felt better about myself.
That’s right, I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all the time.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write.
I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
We hate that guy.
...No, we hate him.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
This is the worst Christmas ever.
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
I love this coat!
So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!
It’s so annoying.
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Chandler!
Oh yeah.
Why?
Okay!
Yeah?
What happened?
Oh God!
Thanks.

Yeah?
Wait! Terry, please!
Thanks a lot.
Really?
Thank you.
Thanks.
Yeah?
Oh! hey, someone left their keys.
What?! Are you crazy?
You can’t marry him!
You think?
Uh-huh.
I guess.
So what are you gonna do?
Sorry.
Are you sure?
Oh God.
What are you doing?
Hi!
I know!
Yeah?
Wait!
Oh crap!
Oh crap!
Really?
No! Ross, come on. No, listen.
Yeah!
Sorry.
Really?!
Thanks.
Me too.
Monica!
Really?
Hey!
Oh my God!
Really?
No.
I know!
Okay!
What?
No way!
Really?!
No!
What?
What do you mean?
Yes!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hi!
Oh my God.
No!
Really?
What are you doing?
Oh my God!

Are you serious?!
Hey! you guys. Is Monica here?
Hey! Oh, God.
What?!
Really?
Oh my God.
Really?!
Really?
No.
What?!
Oh my God!
Oh God!
Chandler!
No!
Why?
No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the new school.
Thank you.
You think?
Why not?!
Oh crap!
Thank you.
Yeah?
What?
No.
Really.
Really?!
Me too.
No.
No.
No.
Thanks.
Are you kidding?
Why?
Oh my God. Phoebe.
Thank you.
Oh my God!
What are you doing?
What?!
Really?
Oh God.
Okay!
Dude! I have never known love like this.
Yeah!
Dude!
Really?!
Why?
No.
You really think so?
Oh no! I don't know anything about cooking.
What are you doing?
Oh no!
Really?
What?
Yeah!
I know!
Thank you.
Go, go, go!
What?
Oh God.
What?!
Right? I mean, it's pretty unbelievable, you know?
Come on!
Are you serious?
No.
Hey!
What?!
